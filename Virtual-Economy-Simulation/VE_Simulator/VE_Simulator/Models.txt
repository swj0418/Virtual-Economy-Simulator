Things to work on first
1. Primary Company behavior -> toward maximizing profits
2. Primary Household behavior -> toward maximizing utility

but they may have different motivations and objectives (sub objectives) so I need to define all those objectives and combine them in
linear relations so that all behaviors can be accounted for.

For example, Divide firm profit into two category
1. Current Profit
2. Future Profit (Investment) "-"

Assume that a firm will try to maximize both their current profit and future profit, but with a degree of discrimination firms operating in some
industries will weigh current profit more and future profit less, and applies vice versa.

1. Maximizing current profit
Using an indifference curve, inputs will be Labor (L), and Capital(K). --> Now every Output level across the model will be measured with this model.

2. Maximizing future profit
Economic entities cannot predict a future, they cannot predict whether their investment today will maximize or even
increase future output. Still, they will invest in K through a decision made by an owner, board, or entities with great respect of responsibility.

People with conservative mind will minimize this investment and people with progressive mind will maximize this investment.
I can define the conservativeness or progressiveness of a firm via averaging members of a company with big responsibilities. eg) CEO, Board Memebers.

//Determinig conservativeness will be dicussed later in personal behavior.

Eventually, A firm will allocate an amount of K based on their characteristics. Invested K will be mostly represented as R&D.
//Return on R&D will be dicussed when I come up with an idea.

Now the final model
Difine,
P = Profit
C = Current
F = Future

>> P = C + F

To aquire C,
use cobb-douglas production function,
Y = A * {K - K(Invested)}^a * L ^ a

//(K(Total) = K + K(Invested))

Price should be subdivided into several prices according to what market they are sold in. Arbitrary posibilities exist.

//This assumption that arbitrary opportunity exists is an unusual assumption given that every economic and financial models and processes assume
no arbitrary opportunity, but in the real world, arbitrary opportunity clearly exists. By saying that an arbitrary opportunity exists I mean that
prices of same goods or services may vary in different markets, but they mostly are not being traded because trading comes with costs (transport,
tax, time, etc...).
This arbitrary relationships across different markets must be dicussed later in depth.

Back to my Current Profit.

>> C = Sum(Price in Market(i) * Quantity in Market(i))

==> Calculating this will need to be followed by defining market demand.
Now, market can be defined as four categories
1. Perfect Competition
2. Monopolistic Competition
3. Oligopoly
4. Monopoly

In a perfect competition market, firm is a price-taker. So I only have to define market demand line. Market demand line will now be introduced.

Market demand is decided by market participants and upon creating market participants' consumption behavior and consumption basket, I can acquire
that markets' comsumption behavior as a whole.
